<p> Welcome, </p>
<p> My name is Mr. Barinas, aka Mr. B, and I regard myself as a STEM teacher who enjoys teaching a wide array of subjects from algebra to biology, computer language and anything in between.  I have a keen interest in teaching students how to code. </p>
<p> I wrote this site with straight up "vanilla" JS, meaning from the ground up. No frameworks, no templates, just mastering every little detail through hard work, which is what I seek to instill in my students.  </p>
<p> I want my students to gain a deep and intuitive understanding of coding principles.  Students learn without the gimmicks and auxiliary programs that often end up as "crutches", hindering their full grasp of the coding languages.
 My philosophy is that students should write clean, highly legible code that provides a dynamic and self-intuititve interface. </p>
<p> My goal is to introduce students to coding and empower them to explore a whole arrange of languages that can open career opportunities in technology.  Coding is the wave of the future and an important skill set to master in our new digital area.  This class is one of the programs EMH Charter provides where students put their mathematical knowledge into practice and are better prepared for today's technology-driven workplace.</p>
